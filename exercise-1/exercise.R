# Exercise 1: calling built-in functions

# Create a variable `my.name` that contains your name
my.name <- "Gloriane"

# Create a variable `name.length` that holds how many letters (including spaces)
# are in your name (use the `nchar()` function)
name.length <- nchar(my.name)

# Print the number of letters in your name
print(name.length)

# Create a variable `now.doing` that is your name followed by "is programming!" 
# (use the `paste()` function)
now.doing <- paste(my.name, "is programing!")

# Make the `now.doing` variable upper case
toupper(now.doing)

### Bonus

# Pick two of your favorite numbers (between 1 and 100) and assign them to 
# variables `fav.1` and `fav.2`
fav.1 <- 7
fav.2 <- 10

# Divide each number by the square root of 201 and save it the new value in the
# original variable
fav.1 <- fav.1 / sqrt(201)
fav.2 <- fav.2 / sqrt(201)

# Create a variable `raw.sum` that is the sum of the two variables. Use the 
# `sum()` function for practice.
raw.sum <- sum(fav.1, fav.2)

# Create a variable `round.sum` that is the `raw.sum` rounded to 1 decimal place.
# Use the `round()` function.
round.sum <- round(raw.sum, 1)

# Create two new variables `round.1` and `round.2` that are your `fav.1` and 
# `fav.2` variables rounded to 1 decimal places

round.1 <- round(fav.1, 1)
round.2 <- round(fav.2, 1)
# Create a variable `sum.round` that is the sum of the rounded values

sum.round <- sum(round.1, round.2)
# Which is bigger, `round.sum` or `sum.round`? (You can use the `max()` function!)
max(round.1, round.2)
